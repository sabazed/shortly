# Security Scanning Implementation

## Overview

Shortly implements comprehensive security scanning using Trivy vulnerability scanner, with automated blocking of critical vulnerabilities and centralized reporting via GitHub Security tab.

## Security Strategy

**Multi-Layer Scanning**: Container images scanned post-build  
**CI/CD Integration**: Automated scans with critical vulnerability blocking  
**GitHub Security**: SARIF results uploaded to centralized security dashboard

## CI/CD Security Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow implements security scanning after successful builds:

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner on mod-url
  if: needs.test-mod-url.result == 'success'
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    image-ref: mod-url:scan
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-mod-url.sarif'
    exit-code: '1'
    severity: 'CRITICAL'
```

**Key Features**:
- Scans all three service images (mod-url, mod-analytics, mod-ui)
- Blocks deployment on CRITICAL vulnerabilities (`exit-code: '1'`)
- Uses `continue-on-error: true` to scan all images before failing
- Categorized SARIF uploads for organized security tracking

## Security Evolution

### Initial State (Standard Images)
After introducing Trivy scanning to the CI pipeline, the initial assessment of the Docker images revealed:

- **~200 vulnerabilities** per image
- **Several critical** vulnerabilities
- **40-50 high severity** issues
- Source: OS packages and system libraries

### Optimization Applied
Migrated to security-optimized Docker strategy using distroless images:

```dockerfile
# Build stage - using official Maven with OpenJDK 21
FROM maven:3.9.8-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build
# ... build process

# Runtime stage - Distroless (no OS)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java21-debian12:nonroot
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
CMD ["app.jar"]
```

**Key Security Improvements**:
- Multi-stage builds eliminate build dependencies
- Distroless runtime (no shell, no OS packages)
- Non-root execution by default
- Minimal attack surface

### Current Results
- **<20 vulnerabilities** per image
- **0 critical** vulnerabilities
- **2-5 high severity** issues
- **Deployment Gate**: Only proceeds if no critical issues found

## Automated Security Gates

**Pipeline Workflow**:
1. Build and test all services
2. Build Docker images locally for scanning
3. Run Trivy scans on each image
4. Upload security findings to GitHub Security tab
5. **Block deployment** if any critical vulnerabilities found
6. Deploy to GitHub Container Registry only on clean scans

**Production Protection**: The `environment: production` requires manual approval and clean security scans.

## Summary

Migration to distroless images eliminated all critical vulnerabilities while maintaining full functionality and enabling automated security-gated deployments.
